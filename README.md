# Flight Ticket Booking Application
This project is an Airline Ticket Booking System that allows users to search for flights, book tickets, and manage their bookings. 
It also includes an admin interface for adding flights, viewing booking details, and managing e-checkin information.
We also used MySQL Database for storing the data.
User Interface:
  - Search for available flights based on date, departure, and arrival airports.
  - Book tickets for selected flights with passenger details.

Admin Interface:
  - Add new flights to the system with departure and arrival information.
  - View details of user bookings.
  - Manage e-checkin details, including approval.

E-Checkin:
  - Users can provide e-checkin details, including passenger name, baggage weight, and age.
  - Admins can view and approve e-checkin submissions.
